# Crop Disease Detection using Federated Learning

## About the Project
Crop diseases are a major problem in agriculture and can reduce crop yield if not detected early.  
In this project, I am building a **crop disease detection system** using **Federated Learning**.

The main idea is to train a machine learning model using data from multiple sources (clients) **without sharing the actual image data**.  
Each client trains the model locally and only shares model updates with the server.

This project is created as a **learning project** to understand:
- Federated Learning
- Image classification
- Privacy-aware machine learning

---
## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Detect crop diseases from leaf images
- Preserve farmer data privacy using Federated Learning
- Enable decentralized model training across multiple clients
- Build a scalable and real-world deployable ML pipeline

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used
- **Federated Learning (FL)** – Distributed model training without centralized data
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** – Image feature extraction and classification
- **Computer Vision** – Leaf image analysis
- **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning**
- **Client–Server Architecture**

## Why Federated Learning?
In traditional machine learning, all data is collected in one place.  
But in real life, especially in agriculture, sharing data is not always possible.
✔ Data privacy for farmers
✔ No centralized data storage
✔ Scalable across regions
✔ Real-world compliant (GDPR-like constraints)

Federated Learning helps by:
- Keeping data on the client side
- Improving privacy
- Allowing multiple users to train a shared model

## What This Project Does
- Uses leaf images to detect crop diseases
- Trains a CNN model on each client
- Uses a federated server to combine model updates
- Evaluates the global model after training

## Dataset
This project uses the **PlantVillage dataset**.  
The dataset contains images of healthy and diseased crop leaves.

To simulate federated learning, the dataset is divided into multiple parts and assigned to different clients.
